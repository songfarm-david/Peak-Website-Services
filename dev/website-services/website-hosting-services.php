			<h3>What Is a Web Host?</h3>
			<p>You can think of a web host as where your website lives on the internet, like renting an apartment for your website to live in on the online world. In more technical terms, website are placed onto special computers called <i>web servers</i> that serve up web pages to prospective visitors via the internet.</p>

			<h3>Why Host on Canadian Soil?</h3>
			<p>If you're at all concerned about the privacy of the information that is on your website, or collected through your website and stored (perhaps information about your customers) then a Canadian-hosted website ensures that your information remains private.<br><br>
			As far as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act" target="_blank">U.S Patriot Act</a> is concerned, there may be little privacy for websites that are hosted in the U.S. Whereas websites that are hosted in Canada are better protected and subject to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act_(Canada)" target="_blank">Canadian Privacy Laws</a>.</p>
