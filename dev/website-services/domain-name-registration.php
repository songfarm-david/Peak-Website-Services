		<h2>Domain Name Registration</h2>
		<p class="h2">Begin the journey to online success with the right domain name.</p>

		<h2>What is a Domain Name?</h2>
		<p>A domain name is your unique address on the web. When somebody refers you to their website, they will tell you the domain name of their website for you to visit. For example, the domain name of <em>this</em> website is <code>peakwebsites.ca</code> (sometimes you will see a &rdquo;www&ldquo; before the domain name. That is not part of a domain name, don't let that confuse you). Other examples of domain names are <code>google.ca</code> or <code>msn.com</code>. Anyone can register a domain name and usually, it is one of the first things you do when you decide you want to have a website.</p>

		<h2>Why is Having a Domain Name Important?</h2>
		<p>Having a domain name is important for a number of reasons. One of the biggest reasons is <em>credibility</em>. A business without a credible website is less trustworthy in the eyes of consumers, and a credible website starts with a good <strong>domain name</strong>. Another reason why having a domain name is important has to do with your <em>brand</em>. Oftentimes, a domain name becomes synonymous with the company it represents. Think <code>apple.com</code> or <code>amazon.com</code>. On their own, they don't really have much meaning, but because we are familiar with these brands, they become symbols for the business. And to think, it started with a domain name...</p>
		<p>Lastly, a domain name is important because &ndash; and let's face it &ndash; the internet is here to stay. Due to the sheer amount of people who use the internet, having a domain name and website creates fantastic opportunities to reach new customers and achieve greater business success.</p>

		<h2>Tips on Choosing A Domain Name</h2>
		<p>Before you decide on a domain name, take time to consider the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Memorable</b> &mdash; A strong domain name is one that is easy to remember and easy to say. If you can convey your business in a catchy, memorable way through a domain name, it'll go a long way in helping others reach your website as well as make it easier for you, the site owner, to refer people to your site. Don't choose a name that's overly long, complicated, or hard to remember!</li>
			<li><b>Concise</b> &mdash; It is often in your best interests to choose a domain name that quickly tells the consumer what your website is all about, for an obvious (if rather bias) example, look at the name <code>peakwebsites.ca</code>. It is pretty clear right away what peakwebsites is all about, is it not? Websites! You don't need to re-invent the wheel. You want concise and memorable. If you are a local company, you may consider using local identifiers (such as the name of the city you operate in) in your domain name to help distinguish your unique domain and offer more information about the products/services you provide.</li>
			<li><b>Relevant</b> &mdash; Before selecting a domain name, it's important that the name you choose conveys the right message to your audience. You will also want to make sure that the domain name reflects your businesses brand. It is a fine line between choosing a name that is relevant in the minds of your consumers but also speaks to your companies values and branding message. Remember that, when in doubt, keep it simple: if you are in the business of making pizzas, then by all means, you'd be wise to include the word &rdquo;pizza&ldquo; in your domain name!</li>
			<li><b>Top-Level Domain</b> &mdash; The <em><code>.com</code></em> or <em><code>.org</code></em> part of a domain name is called the Top-Level Domain (or TLD, for short). Recently, there has been an explosion of new TLD's to choose from, for example, <code>.band</code>, <code>.photography</code>, <code>.cars</code>. Sometimes, when the TLD you want is either taken, or too expensive to register, you can find a great, creative TLD that fits well with your company brand. It's equally important to note that certain TLDs are <em>country-specific</em> (for example, <code>.ca</code> is the TLD for Canada) or related to non-profits (<code>.org</code>) or government organizations (<code>.gov</code>). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains">See a full list of Top-Level Domains</a>.</li>

		<h2>How Do I Register a Domain Name?</h2>
		<p>The first step to registering a domain (once you have settled on the domain name you want) is to find a Registrar. There are a lot of Registrars out there but be choosy in who you go with; there are some Registrars who will do some <a href="https://www.easydns.com/10-things-to-know-before-you-register/">nasty stuff</a> in the name of profit, so be sure to find an ethical Registrar you trust. Once you find a Registrar, he or she will do an availablity search for the domain name you want. If it's available and priced to sell, then your Registrar will register the domain name on your behalf. You will then be the owner of that domain name - Yippee! The period for which you can register a domain name is variable: you may register a domain name for 1, 2, up to 10 years (sometimes even 100 years!). Whatever length you choose is up to you. If you only registered a domain name for 1 year, you have the first option to re-register that domain name before it expires, so there is little need to worry that you will lose the domain name you worked so hard to come up with! Sometimes it saves money to register your domain for a longer period and sometimes not. A good registrar will provide you with all your options as well as help you to make the best choice for you based on your particular situation.</p>
