						<h3 class="title">Questions About Website Maintenance</h3>
						<p class="question">How does Website Maintenance work?</p>
						<p>When you sign up for one of our fixed <a href="#">monthly service packages</a>, you are guaranteed a set portion of hours dedicated to adding or updating content on your website. This is on on top of the already included <a href="#">features</a>.</p>
						<p>When you have the need to change or add content to your website, simply send us an email detailing what you want done and we’ll take care of the rest.</p>
						<p>If you can’t find anything you want done that month, the hours included in your package will be used to address other aspects of your website, like SEO, or technical performance.</p>
						<p>Each month, you’ll get a detailed report about your website’s traffic, it’s performance, the work we did, and what we have in mind for the future.</p>
						<p>Anyway you slice it, you’re investment is put to good use.</p>

						<p class="question">How does Website Maintenance work?</p>
						<p>A typical service request will be completed within 48 hours and often within 12 - 24 hours. In the event of larger undertakings, updates may take a few days.</p>
						<p>In any case, the work will get done when we say it will.</p>

						<p class="question">Do I have to sign a contract?</p>
						<p>No. All of our website maintenance packages are paid month-to-month. You are free to cancel at any time as well as upgrade or downgrade your service as you see fit.</p>

						<p class="question">What can I expect in a Website Health and Traffic Report?</p>
						<p>A Website Health and Traffic Report is a great way to let you know how your website is performing both on the customer-facing side, your web traffic, and in terms of the technical and performance-related front.</p>
						<p>We want you to understand how your website is doing so that, together, we can make better informed decisions in how we service and maintain your website for optimal results.</p>
						<p>Each month, we will give you insights into who’s coming to your website and how they’re behaving once they’re there. We’ll also tell you what search terms they’re using to find you online.</p>
						<p>In addition to that, we’ll let you know how your website is performing from a technical perspective so there are no surprises down the road.</p>
						<p>In our experience, there is no better way of making progress than measuring current success, and our Website Health and Traffic Reports do just that!</p>

						<p class="question">Do you really offer Unlimited Content Updates?</p>
						<p>Well, we are human after all. But yes, there isn’t a limit to what you can request.</p>
						<p>Of course, each package offers different pricing structures and benefits should you go over your monthly allotted time.</p>
						<p>If you expect you will need more time regularly, contact us for a custom quote.</p>
