	<h2>Do I need a website if I do business online?</h2>
	<p>
		If you do business online, or plan on having your own online business, having a website is essential to your online success. Besides representing your business online, a website is where site visitors have an opportunity to become paying customers.
	</p>
	<p>
		The unfortunate fact, however, is that too many websites today make converting visitors harder than it needs to be and what might have started off as paying customer for your business is now one for your <u>competitors</u>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Peak Creative is different. We think a website should serve a clear purpose, and that that purpose should guide and inform everything else. Every project begins by first understanding the goal of the project. That is step one of the <a href="">website creation process</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		From there...
