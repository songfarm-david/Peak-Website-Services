				<h3>What's Included?</h3>
				<p>
					Included in every website we do is the following:
				</p>
				<ul class="feature-list">
					<li>
						<span>Built strong under-the-hood</span>
						<p>
							When it comes to designing and developing your website, we are sticklers for industry best-practices. That means your website behaves like it should. And if you do run into a bug, we'll make it right, no questions asked.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>No Page Limits</span>
						<p>
							The ultimate purpose of your website should be to support your online business goals, regardless of the amount of pages required.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Mobile Friendly &amp; Responsive</span>
						<p>
							No question about it: <a href="#">Mobile Browsing is on the Rise</a>, which means your website has to look good and function everywhere &mdash; but don't sweat it, crafting mobile-friendly websites is just another day at the office for us.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>SEO Enhanced</span>
						<p>
							Websites need traffic in order to thrive. We build our sites on top of industry leading best-practices to ensure your website can be understood and index by all the major search engines.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Accessible</span>
						<p>
							Think of accessible websites like accessibility ramps for brick-and-mortar establishments. Although, often overlooked by other web companies, we believe that your website should be accessible to everyone.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Optimized for Conversion</span>
						<p>
							Because at the end of the day your website is a tool for turning visitors into customers, conversion is at the core of every website we build.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
