Can I still use your service?</dt><dd>Yes. If your website is already being hosted elsewhere, we recommend<a href="faq.php#migrate-a-website">migrating your website</a>to our hosting datacenter located in Canada. This allows us complete control over the maintenance and optimization of your online presence and removes any third-parties that may restrict progress on your site.</dd><dt id="migrate-a-website"><i class="fa fa-plus-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;What does it mean to migrate a website?</dt><dd>When your website lives on one computer and you wish for it to live on another computer, then you will perform a website migration. The term 'computer', in this context, refers to a web server, which is a computer designed to host websites and all their accompanying files. When we perform a website migration, we are moving your website from one server to another.<br><br>This procedure can sometimes be quick and painless (if the two servers in question are relatively similar); on the other hand, they can sometimes be more arduous. Should you require a website migration, this will be included into the setup cost and will depend on the size and severity of the migration.</dd><dt id="domain-name"><i class="fa fa-plus-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;What is a Domain Name</dt><dd>A domain name, such as<i>peakwebsites.ca</i>, or<i>amazon.com</i>is a human-readable format for identifying websites on the internet. I say human-readable because computers do not use domain names as much as they use IP address, or unique strings of alpha characters to uniquely identify the location of website resources on the internet.</dd><dt id="unlimited-pages"><i class="fa fa-plus-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;Can you really support the claim of "No Page Limits"?</dt><dd>In a literal sense, nobody can provide unlimited pages &mdash; there are only so many hours in a day. However, keeping it in the context of a particular business or website, the amount of pages is a direct correlation to the particular goals of the business. So, whether that's 5 pages or 500 pages, it's irrelevant. The real question is how many pages are necessary to satisfy the purpose of your website.</dd><dt id="mobile"><i class="fa fa-plus-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;Will my Website Work on Mobile Phones</dt><dd>Of course! We design all our websites with mobile in mind. From there, we expand our development to include larger devices, such as tablets, laptops, and desktop computers. You can be sure that you'll have a product that is designed to function on today's devices, regardless of its size and mobility.</dd><dt id="index"><i class="fa fa-plus-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;What does it mean to "index" a website</dt><dd>Search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo employ automated website crawlers, or spiders, that spend all their time crawling the internet, following links, and "indexing" the information that they find. All of this information is added to an ever-changing, ever-growing index of content and information that is then served up to search engines users.<br><br>These same search engines have expressed a preference for well-coded, semantic webpages that their spiders &mdash; or bots &mdash; can quickly and easily crawl and index.<br><br>Making sure your website is easily understood and crawlable, from the perspective of the search engines, goes a long way to ensuring your website is indexed and returned in the search results.</dd></dl></div></section></main> <?php require_once('_includes/footer.php') ?>
