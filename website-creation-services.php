		So whats the difference between an effective website &mdash; one that works <em>for</em> you &mdash; and a not-so-effective one?
	</p>
	<p>
		At Peak Creative, we believe that a website should have a clear purpose, and although that purpose differs from business to business, the measure of an effective website is how well it fulfills its purpose to your business. That purpose, which we discover early on/first in the website creation process, guides our decisions going forward.
