# Our Process - The Website Creation Model for Small Online Business
Here we would discuss our approach to our work for our clients.
1. Determine the target: What is the ultimate goal/goals of our engagement? Are their any technical/browser requirements for this project?
	This is defining a clear picture or idea of what the end result of the product/project will be.
2. Plan/Strategy
	Here we take everything we've learned from the prior stage and begin creating a strategy for reaching that conclusion. This stage may include SEO keyword research, Competitive Research, Market Research. We also look at any special requirements that the project might need to reach it's goals, such as a Content Management System (CMS) or E-Commerce solution.
3. Creation/Design
	After we are clear on what our objective is and we know what we will need to get to that objective, we begin the creation process. Here we will create website design prototypes, brand assets (e.g: logo) such as a logo or campaign brand imaging (if required for the project), and content should the project require it.
4. Development/Testing
	The coding and building of the website, in combination with the keyword research and all prior project details that were realized in stage 2 would describe the development stage of the Website Creation Process. Initial testing would also be performed during the development stage.
5. Launch
	The website is ready for launch. Up to now, we have registered your unique domain name and set up your online business with high-speed, secure web hosting. You're all ready to go. Now what? (This could link to a "maintenance" service page).
* This web service includes keeping your website online (so they pay me to pay the web host, to make sure their website stays online, that their domain name remains registered, etc...) What's that worth to me?
* Unlimited Support.
* Domain Name Registration/Hosting Caretaking

#Website Maintenance Service/The Website LifeCycle
	Websites don't live in a vacuum. Just like most things, they need to be *maintained*. As technology evolves, one must keep a finger on the pulse of the web, and more importantly, on the heartbeat of your website.

#Website Optimization
	Anyone who's serious and committed about their online business strives to increase the impact their time and money has towards having their website working *for them*. Search Engine Optimization, or SEO, as it's referred to more commonly in industry, is the ongoing process of remaining relevant and consistently connecting in the search results to your online target audience. That's how you get your online business working FOR you.
	However, SEO is not a set it and forget it affair. It requires careful course correction and somebody who knows how to steer the ship.
	Peak's Website Optimization Web Service ideally begins at the very beginning of your online business life span; if you're not currently seeing the kind of results you were hoping for, don't worry, it's never too late to re-direct the ship.
	We begin by getting a broad sense of your particular market climate, the competition, and any unique opportunities and potential that becomes apparent through our research efforts. We also get a clear feel of the current health of your web presence in light of your competitors and your desired goal.
	Not only do we oversee the journey, we also provide our clients with valuable and clarifying reports and projections surrounding the health and visibility of your website.
	When it comes to SEO, strong planning and patience is rewarded. Fortunately for us, those are two of our strong suits. Allow us to guide your online business to acheive for your website optimal visibility for your key audience and begin to fulfill your online business goals.
