### Our Process - The Website Creation Model for Small Online Business
	Here we would discuss our approach to our work for our clients.
	1. Determine the target: What is the ultimate goal/goals of our engagement? Are their any technical/browser requirements for this project?
		This is defining a clear picture or idea of what the end result of the product/project will be.
	2. Plan/Strategy
		Here we take everything we've learned from the prior stage and begin creating a strategy for reaching that conclusion. This stage may include SEO keyword research, Competitive Research, Market Research. We also look at any special requirements that the project might need to reach it's goals, such as a Content Management System (CMS) or E-Commerce solution.
	3. Creation/Design
		After we are clear on what our objective is and we know what we will need to get to that objective, we begin the creation process. Here we will create website design prototypes, brand assets (e.g: logo) such as a logo or campaign brand imaging (if required for the project), and content should the project require it.
	4. Development/Testing
		The coding and building of the website, in combination with the keyword research and all prior project details that were realized in stage 2 would describe the development stage of the Website Creation Process. Initial testing would also be performed during the development stage.
	5. Launch
		The website is ready for launch. Up to now, we have registered your unique domain name and set up your online business with high-speed, secure web hosting. You're all ready to go. Now what? (This could link to a "maintenance" service page).
	* This web service includes keeping your website online (so they pay me to pay the web host, to make sure their website stays online, that their domain name remains registered, etc...) What's that worth to me?

##Portfolio
	The portfolio section does not need to follow any particular format, although it does have to be pleasing and intuitive for visitors. One idea is to have added testimonials around the client/subject, as well as adding a preface about the project and 'prev/next' buttons for going on to the next portfolio item.
