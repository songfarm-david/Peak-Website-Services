# Changelog

## 'Peak' (prefix version number)

###3.0.1
- Hide navigation site-wide
- Completely shifted around the copy text and layout/style of the landing page. All links are (should be) pointing to the contact page until I have more time to tinker with the contact form.
-	Also extended Gruntfile to include a Modernizr check for flexbox while contending with some columns at the bottom of the landing page. *Review this file as not all details are remembered at this time.*
- Simplify Footer
