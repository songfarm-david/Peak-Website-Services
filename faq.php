	<dd><em>Better</em> may not be the best word to describe it, but if you're at all concerned about the privacy of the information that is on your website, or collected through your website and stored (perhaps in a database), then a Canadian-hosted website is the only way to go. </dd>
	<dt id="existing-host">My website is already being hosted somewhere</dt>
	<dd>
		If your website is already being hosted elsewhere, we recommend <a href="faq.php#migrate-a-website">migrating your website</a> to our hosting datacenter. We recommend this to allow us at Peak the ability to optimize your maintenance service experience. If we don't have access to your website or host servers, our services are greatly limited and we may not be able to help you the way we would like.

	<dt id="migrate-a-website">What does it mean to migrate a Website?</dt>
	<dd>
		The same way birds will migrate from one hemisphere to the other, sometimes a website must be migrated from one datacenter (host) to another. This is usually a simple process, however sometimes it requires a little more finesse. At Peak Website Services we will do the migration for you (usually free of charge barring any unforeseen complications). <a href="contact.php">Contact Us</a> if you require your website be migrated.

	<dt>Do you do Website Migration?</dt>
	<dd>Typically, migrating a website is a labor-intensive undertaking and often will require a dedicated effort to successfully perform.
		Under other circumstances, website migration might be a relatively simple and expediate process and should not require any significant allocation of time or resources.
		If you have an existing website, we can address your particular migration needs as we formulate our service requirements.

	<dt id="unlimited-pages">What do you mean by unlimited pages?</dt>
	<dd>Obviously, in a literal sense, nobody can realistically offer you unlimited pages. So, keeping it in the context of a particular business or website goal, we don't believe in restricting customers to a set number of pages. Business needs and website requirements come in all shapes and sizes. One size fits all just doesn't apply here.</dd>
