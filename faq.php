	<dd><em>Better</em> may not be the best word to describe it, but if you're at all concerned about the privacy of the information that is on your website, or collected through your website and stored (perhaps in a database), then a Canadian-hosted website is the only way to go. </dd>

		If your website is already being hosted elsewhere, we recommend <a href="faq.php#migrate-a-website">migrating your website</a> to our hosting datacenter. We recommend this to allow us at Peak the ability to optimize your maintenance service experience.

At Peak Website Services we will do the migration for you (usually free of charge barring any unforeseen complications). <a href="contact.php">Contact Us</a> if you require your website be migrated.
