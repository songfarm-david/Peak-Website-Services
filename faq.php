				<dt id="canadian-hosting">What's so special about hosting my website in Canada as opposed to the U.S?</dt>
				<dd>
					If you're at all concerned about the privacy of the information that is on your website, or collected through your website and stored (perhaps information about your customers) then a Canadian-hosted website ensures that your information remains private.<br>
					As far as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act">U.S Patriot Act</a> is concerned, there may be little privacy for websites that are hosted in the U.S. Whereas websites that are hosted in Canada are better protected and subject to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act_(Canada)">Canadian Privacy Laws</a>.
				</dd>
				<dt>Will hosting my website in Canada impact the performance of my website in the States?</dt>
				<dd>
					No. Our datacenters are located coast-to-coast across Canada and offer excellent peering service to the United States.
				</dd>
				<dt>What about locations Worldwide?</dt>
				<dd>
					For geographic locations outside of North America, partner hosting servers may be used to ensure that your website can be accessed from anywhere in the world. If this is something you require for you business, <a href="/peak/contact.php">please speak to us</a>.
				</dd>
				<dt id="existing-host">My website is already being hosted somewhere else. Can I still use your service?</dt>
				<dd>
					If your website is already being hosted elsewhere, we recommend <a href="faq.php#migrate-a-website">migrating your website</a> to our hosting datacenter located in Canada.
					This allows us complete control over the maintenance and optimization of your online presence and removes any third-parties that may restrict progress on your site.
				</dd>
				<dt id="migrate-a-website">What does it mean to migrate a website?</dt>
				<dd>
					When your website lives on one computer and you wish for it to live on another computer, then you will perform a website migration. The term 'computer', in this context, refers to a web server, which is a computer designed to host websites and all their accompanying files. When we perform a website migration, we are moving your website from one server to another.<br>
					This procedure can sometimes be quick and painless (if the two servers in question are relatively similar); on the other hand, they can sometimes be more arduous. Should you require a website migration, this will be included into the setup cost and will depend on the size and severity of the migration.

				<!-- <dt id="monthly-performance-reports">What can I expect to see in a Monthly Website Health Report</dt>
				<dd>
					As a customer of our Website Maintenance Service Plan, you will receive monthly website health reports that will brief you on ...
				</dd> -->
				<dt id="domain-name">What is a Domain Name</dt>
				<dd>
					A domain name, such as peakwebsites.ca, or amazon.com is a human-readable format for identifying websites on the internet. I say human-readable because computers do not use domain names as much as they use IP address, or unique strings of alpha characters to uniquely identify the location of website resources on the internet.
				</dd>
				<dt id="search-engine-visibility">Search Engine Visibility</dt>
				<dd>
					What is search engine visibility. Explain as if to a 5-year old
				</dd>
				<dt id="unlimited-pages">Can you really support the claim of "No Page Limits"?</dt>
				<dd>
					In a literal sense, nobody can provide unlimited pages &mdash; there are only so many hours in a day. However, keeping it in the context of a particular business or website, the amount of pages is a direct correlation to the particular goals of the business. So, whether that's 5 pages or 500 pages, it's irrelevant. The real question is how many pages are necessary to satisfy the purpose of your website.</dd>
				<dt id="mobile">Will my Website Work on Mobile Phones</dt>
				<dd>
					Of course! We typically begin all of our websites by developing for mobile-first and then expanding to larger devices, such as Tablets and Desktops. By the end of our work together, you will have a website that functions and looks great across all devices.</dd>
				<dt id="index">What does it mean to "index" a website</dt>
				<dd>
					Search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo employ automated website crawlers, or spiders, that spend all their time crawling the internet, following links, and "indexing" the information that they find. All of this information is added to an ever-changing, ever-growing index of content and information that is then served up to search engines users.
					These same search engines have expressed a preference for well-coded, semantic webpages that their spiders &mdash; or bots &mdash; can quickly and easily crawl and index. <br>
					Making sure your website is easily understood and crawlable, from the perspective of the search engines, goes a long way to ensuring your website is indexed and returned in the search results.
