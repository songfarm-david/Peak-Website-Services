# Template Readme

The body of code is designed as somewhat of a jumping-off point into building a fully fluid, grid-based and LESS enhanced development environment.

It is populated by such code aids as bootstrap functionality for javascript/behavioral effects, modernizr browser feature recognition (jury's still out on that one), including jQuery and a comprehensive browser reset and more.. It will provide a solid foundation to stretch and pull the components as called for by the design.
