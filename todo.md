## footer
Revisit footer and test for footer vendor dependencies and fallbacks. Found issue when working with jQuery. Unreliable fallback.

* Add css styles that control main above the fold content to head of document
* Add 404 page.
* Have a copy of fonts in case the internet goes down!
* make sure meta description on index.php is based on keywords

#user experience testing
* go through forms and such on ipad and iphones to see how the user experience is
* browser test the website in IE7 and test for fallbacks.
